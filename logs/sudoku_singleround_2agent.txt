Observation: "BEST\nof\nSudoku has become a very ubiquitous game in our world. People play it online, they play it in newspapers, and they play it while they‚Äôre bored on an airplane. Basically anywhere someone might have some downtime there‚Äôs probably someone playing sudoku. This math-based puzzle has taken the world by storm and the vast majority of people are thrilled about that.\nIf you‚Äôve played you‚Äôve definitely gotten to the dreaded point where you don‚Äôt know how to solve the puzzle. Maybe you erase and start over, or maybe you just give up. No matter what level of Sudoku you‚Äôre at, you‚Äôve most likely wondered if there are strategies you can use to improve your game.\nJust like with solitaire or mahjong there are strategies out there that you can use to help increase your chances of solving the sudoku puzzle. It just takes some practice and research to figure out what the strategies are and how they work. If you‚Äôre hoping to up your game and get some well-deserved pats on the back from yourself you‚Äôre in good hands here.\nYou‚Äôre about to get a deep dive into the world of sudoku, the strategies, and the answers to questions you may have wondered at some point. Maybe you‚Äôve asked yourself when sudoku took over the world as a boredom stopper. (It was invented in 1979 by Howard Garns who based it off of similar games dating back to the 18th century in case you‚Äôre curious.)\nBefore you pick up your pencil or open your app, take some time to read about the strategies and tips here. You might just be able to solve a higher level of puzzle by the time you‚Äôre done reading. It‚Äôs all about knowing how to work the game and enjoying it in the process. No one becomes a sudoku genius overnight but these strategies will definitely help.\nThe objective of Sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid made of squares (shown above circled in blue) so that each row, each column, and each full 9x9 square use the numbers 1-9. While solving the sudoku puzzle you can only use each number one time in the square, column, and row.\nColumns and rows are not limited by the thicker boundaries of the square (also sometimes called a region.) They run from the top of the puzzle to the bottom of the puzzle (as pictured in blue above). The same is true of rows. So while you may be focusing on a square, you‚Äôll also have to remember other squares are affected by your choices.\nYou won‚Äôt be able to put a 1 in both the top left corner of the grid and the bottom left corner of the grid, for example. That entire space is a column, and as you already know, columns must not repeat any of the allowed numbers.\nNo. In a Magic Square, you also have to take into account the diagonal portion of the puzzle. Sudoku only focuses on the squares, rows, and columns in the grid. So, while the concepts are similar, they are not the exact same game.\nSome people claim Magic Squares are harder because of the added diagonal factor, while others claim Sudoku requires more concentration and logic. It really is dependent on what you like best, but in the end, they are still not the exact same thing.\nThere are a huge amount of variations on the basic 9x9 grid version of Sudoku. You can do puzzles that change the grid size to 6x6 or even 25x25. There are also other variations like Sudoku-X which adds in the factor of diagonals making it even more similar to a Magic Square.\nIn Sudoku Even-Odd you have shaded squares that must have either an even or an odd number, depending on the rules of that particular puzzle. In Hanidoku you use hexagonal shapes to create a ‚Äúgrid‚Äù that almost looks like a beehive.\nIn all variants the basic rules usually remain the same, they just add on some extra rules to increase the level of challenge for the avid Sudoku player to enjoy something new. There are tons of easily found variations of Sudoku you can try out once you master the basics and understand the strategies talked about as you keep reading.\nSudoku puzzles come prefilled with numbers in some of the cells. They are ranked by a difficulty level which corresponds with how many numbers come pre-filled in the puzzle. The higher the difficulty the fewer prefilled numbers you will have. The ratings go from one star (easiest) to five stars (hardest).\nJust like any other muscle your brain benefits from a good workout. If you find yourself doing mundane tasks daily Sudoku could be a way to sharpen your mind a little. It forces you to really think and plan. It gives you something to take all of your attention off of stressful days or worries.\nSudoku has also been linked to declines in the potential for dementia to progress and has helped patients with mental health issues regain some normal daily function abilities. How Sudoku can help your brain is really just about keeping your brain going and your mind sharp. Your individual benefits may not be the same as others, but it‚Äôs still offering you a constructive way to pass time.\nStarting your puzzle is sometimes a key part of making sure you solve the whole thing in the end. Because the puzzles are partially filled it can be difficult to make the first move. The best strategy here is to use the process of elimination. Look at what numbers you‚Äôd like to use and mark those numbers in the cells with a pencil.\nYou can make them small marks that are easily erased but make sure you‚Äôre putting any possible number in the cell. Then check to see if they‚Äôve been repeated in any area you plan to place them. (See picture below)\nIf you‚Äôre using the process of elimination as your strategy you can see that although placing a 1 in the upper corner is tempting, it‚Äôs not a viable move. The number has already been used in the square. It also cannot be used in the column of the square below it because it has been prefilled there too. That leaves you with only one option. The bottom left.\nThis is how the process of elimination strategy works. You‚Äôll have to broaden your view of the puzzle. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of only looking at one square. Always remember columns and rows matter too. It‚Äôs all connected. Strategically eliminating possible moves is the best way to start your game.\nThis is a technique slightly the opposite of what you just read about. With crosshatching, you start by focusing on one 3x3 square and filling it in with the numbers needed. It‚Äôs a way to give you a starting point for your game that doesn‚Äôt involve looking at the entire grid.\nCrosshatching can be especially useful for brand new Sudoku players who are overwhelmed with an entire grid to fill. The downfall is that you could find yourself going back to correct a lot of errors as the puzzle gets more filled in. This doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad technique. It‚Äôs just something you should be aware of if you choose to start your puzzle this way.\nSudoku is not like solitaire where there‚Äôs some luck involved. There are definite ways to solve the puzzle. You might be able to guess and get a lucky right answer, but in general yes, sudoku is solved without guessing. Instead of guessing use strategic thoughtful moves.\nUse the strategy of ‚Äúscan and find‚Äù instead of getting too stuck on one square on the grid. If you can‚Äôt figure out a number scanning and finding a good spot is always the better strategy. Guessing will not improve your game skills or chances of winning.\nThere are actually quite a few strategies sudoku lovers use, and which ones are best vary widely based on who you‚Äôre talking to. When it comes to sudoku the best strategy is going to be the one that makes the most sense to you. If a strategy just isn‚Äôt working there are others to try so don‚Äôt give up. Move on to the next strategy or combine several to get the puzzle solved.\nAs you read on you‚Äôll be able to see some commonly used strategies that help people solve their puzzles. Some strategies are more difficult to master than others. Some strategies are meant for advanced players while others are great for beginners. It‚Äôs all about what‚Äôs going to work for you and what makes sense in your mind.\nTry not to get stuck on one specific strategy. It‚Äôs completely fine to have a favorite strategy to use but remember that sometimes you might need to use something else to solve the puzzle. If you‚Äôre finding yourself stuck think back to the other strategies you‚Äôre reading about here. Something is bound to help.\nIllustration Of A Naked Pair (As you can see each cell highlighted has 2 possible numbers.)\nThis strategy is based on looking at the puzzle and deciding which numbers are the only possibility for a specific cell. It‚Äôs similar to the process of elimination you would‚Äôve used to start your puzzle. In a naked pair, you know you have 2 possible numbers that will be able to work in the pair, but you have yet to figure out which will go where.\nWhen you have a naked pair you can use this strategy to remove the idea of using the 2 numbers in any other row, square/region, or column. From there you‚Äôll have to deduce which number makes the most sense based on looking at the row or column it‚Äôs in.\nIf you know the naked pair has either a two or a six as the possible answer, check to see where those numbers are used already. Remember, you can‚Äôt repeat any of the digits you‚Äôve used.\nNaked pairs do not have to align within the grid. They can be naked pairs and be scattered within the square too.\nNo matter where they fall the point of the strategy is that you know there are only 2 possible numbers that can be placed in those cells and that you need to use the process of elimination to find the right one.\nThis same idea can also be applied to what more advanced players will call naked triplets (or threes) and naked quads. It‚Äôs more difficult than a pair because you‚Äôll have 3 or 4 possible numbers which means you‚Äôll have to solve more of the puzzle than you would with a naked pair.\nExample of how hidden pairs can distort the true options for a cell.\nThis is a great way to open up your grid and get a good feel for where to place numbers. The hidden pair strategy is a way to eliminate clusters of numbers from two cells which leaves you with simple options for the rest of the cells. It‚Äôs a building block for more advanced strategies later.\nTo use this strategy you‚Äôll want to look at what numbers have been filled in already. Then look through your square, columns, and rows to rule out those numbers as options. When you do that you‚Äôll be left with a simple pair of number options which you can build on to win the game.\nIn the above example, you can see that the hidden pair appears to have a multitude of options. Its true value is ‚Äúhidden‚Äù by the appearance of several numeric possibilities. But if we apply the rule of looking through columns and rows we can see that the actual value of those cells is limited to being either a 6 or 7. You‚Äôve used the hidden pairs strategy to rule out everything else.\nAgain, this strategy can be used in triplets or quads but that could take more practice. It‚Äôs not as easy to rule things out when you have more numeric choices. It‚Äôs best to start practicing this strategy with pairs and work your way up from there.\nImage Via Sudoku Wiki\nWhen you‚Äôre looking at your grid there may be a number that continues to pop up as a possibility within a specific square. If the numbers are aligned in the same column or row they are called a pointing pair. The pointing pair tells you the number must be used in that line and can be ruled out from other possible cells.\nIn other words, the repeated possibility aligned within a square ‚Äúpoints‚Äù to where along the rest of the row or column you can eliminate the number. If you know 3 is a repeated possibility and they‚Äôre aligned in the same row or column within the square, you can then rule 3 out from any other cell in those rows or columns.\nThe 3 has to be placed within the square you‚Äôre looking at, it‚Äôs just a matter of figuring out which of the two cells the 3 will be used in. This helps you rule out a lot of possibilities and gives you the chance to fill in some rows or columns because you know a 3 can‚Äôt go in any of those cells. It‚Äôs a more methodical version of searching and eliminating without a plan.\nThis is another strategy to help eliminate possibilities and make the entire puzzle more easily solved. Are you noticing a theme with these strategies? It‚Äôs all about ruling out what can‚Äôt go somewhere instead of focusing on what should be put somewhere. Intersection removal is no exception to that line of thinking.\nIf any number occurs as a possibility two or three times in any one unit (row, square, or column) you can then remove that number from any intersecting other units. The key to using this strategy is to really fully understand what a unit is in the game. Remember that while it‚Äôs easy to focus on one square, you‚Äôre trying to solve the whole grid.\nImage Via Game Sudoku\nIf the pair or triplet of numbers intersects with another row, column or square it can be eliminated as a possibility for that intersecting unit. Another way to methodically use the process of elimination to get to the final result. This one just takes a little more focus on the entire grid than previous strategies mentioned.\nFor this strategy, you‚Äôre going to be looking at parallel rows and columns. You won‚Äôt be focusing on squares as much right now. It‚Äôs a strategy to remove possible numbers and erase some of those pencil marks you made when you started your game.\nTake a look at your rows and see if there are any pencil marks that are exactly the same in two spots. Match up that row with another row that mirrors it. The pencil marks must be exactly the same in the same two spots. You can see an example below to get a better idea.\nAs you can see, the parallel rows create an X giving this strategy its name. Looking at the example above you can now see that each of these rows has to have a 4 in it. You also know you can only place the 4 in either the slots that are dark blue, or light blue, since doing anything else would cause a repeated number in the row or column.\nAfter you‚Äôve established your X formation, look at the entire grid again. See if there‚Äôs already a repeated number issue somewhere. This will guide you to the right choice to erase and the right cell to place the X formation numeral.\nThis is a strategy that takes a lot of thought but it does work very well. It‚Äôs not a strategy for beginners, but if you‚Äôre looking to improve your skills it‚Äôs a good choice. It will help you develop the skills required to move beyond focusing on just one square or one row or column. It helps you see the bigger picture.\nRemember how the X wing involved 2 possible numbers in two rows? This is the same idea, except now we‚Äôre looking at 3 possible numbers in 3 rows or columns. It‚Äôs an advanced strategy for sure. If you haven‚Äôt mastered the X wing strategy yet, you‚Äôll likely find this strategy frustrating and possibly useless.\nImage Via Learn Sudoku\nWhile this strategy is not actually useless it is something that‚Äôs hard to spot when you‚Äôre looking at potential numbers for your cells. In the above image, the red lines show you that there‚Äôs a possibility for a 5 in the same slots in each of the red-lined rows.\nThe blue lines show you the slots where a 5 matches up and crosses the blue line itself. In short, the blue lines are showing you where you have the possibility of placing a five. If there is not a somewhere that a blue and red line intersect, you can eliminate five as a candidate in that cell.\nThe blue lines will not tell you WHICH cell the five goes in, it just shows you what to eliminate. In the image, you can see that with this strategy the cells highlighted in blue are the ones that might have a five. The cells that cannot have a five are highlighted in red.\nAgain, this is a highly advanced and somewhat complicated strategy to use for solving your puzzle. It‚Äôs best left to Sudoku fans that have been playing for a long time and truly understand how grid patterns work. If you‚Äôre just starting out and attempt this strategy you will likely be unable to see the patterns and end up not solving that particular puzzle.\nThis is a technique you can use when you haven‚Äôt found something that‚Äôs working for you on the puzzle yet. Maybe you‚Äôve tried other strategies and you‚Äôre at an impasse or you just need a fresh perspective. Slicing and slotting breaks up the puzzle into rows of 3 for you to really analyze what‚Äôs missing or what‚Äôs incorrect.\nYou‚Äôll compare the three rows going number by number. Start in numeric order and go up from there. So while you‚Äôre looking at your isolated 3 rows look for every blank spot and see what your possibilities (those pencil marks we talked about) are. This is especially effective if you‚Äôve eliminated candidates at this point.\nWhile scanning your three rows look to see where there are already cells with the number you‚Äôre scanning for. If you‚Äôre using the number 1 as your first scan, for example, you‚Äôll want to take note of where in those three rows that number already exists. If you find the number you‚Äôre scanning for, look to see how it interacts with your still unsolved cells.\nSo, if you‚Äôre scanning for the number one, and you find a 1 in the set of three rows you‚Äôre scanning check your candidates in that square, row, and column. If you have 1 as a candidate in any of those areas you now know you can eliminate it as a possibility. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to place a 1 there, because it‚Äôs already in the row, column, or square.\nImage via Sudoku Grader\nIn the image above you can see this more clearly. The red lines are showing you that in these three focused on columns, you cannot place a 2 anywhere there‚Äôs a red line. The 2 has been taken and cannot be reused in that row, square, or column. Therefore if you‚Äôd had a 2 as a candidate in one of the red line areas of this example, you could eliminate it.\nThis isn‚Äôt a guaranteed way to save your game from being unsolved but it is a good way to break things down. Sometimes you just need a micro focus that allows you to really see what‚Äôs going on. That‚Äôs what ‚Äúslicing and slotting‚Äù can do for you while solving your Sudoku puzzle.\nIt depends on what you‚Äôre thinking of when you say ‚Äúmath.‚Äù This is why people who don‚Äôt understand the game often ask what the squares need to add up to in order to solve the puzzle. A Sudoku puzzle doesn‚Äôt require arithmetic, meaning you don‚Äôt have to add or subtract anything.\nFor a Sudoku game you really just need 9 symbols, and numbers just happen to be the most popular version. You could just as well use shapes and still present the same type of puzzle with the same rules and the same outcome. In fact, there are Sudoku versions where letters or symbols are used instead of numbers just to change things up.\nHowever, Sudoku does require mathmatically logical thinking. So when you‚Äôre asking if you can use math to solve a puzzle, the answer really is yes. It‚Äôs just probably not the kind of math you‚Äôre thinking of. Sudoku is solved with logical reasoning heavily based on concepts used in mathematics.\nIn most cases, there is only one solution for a Sudoku puzzle. If you find that a prefilled puzzle has more than one solution the publisher likely made a mistake, or you‚Äôve completed the puzzle incorrectly. However, if the puzzle is blank there are definitely multiple solutions.\nIn the most extreme case where a puzzle has zero prefilled number clues, Wikipedia states there could be up to 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 solutions. So, while in general every puzzle only has one solution, if you did want to do a completely blank Sudoku puzzle, yes, there are definitely many solution options.\nWhile there seems to be some disagreement on this within the Sudoku fan community, most agree that a true Sudoku puzzle is never unsolvable. They state that a real Sudoku puzzle has one and only one solution. If you work on a puzzle that is unsolvable, it is either an error in printing, or not a true Sudoku puzzle. It is another type of game based on a Sudoku type of grid.\nThere are websites and publications dedicated to purposely creating unsolvable puzzles, but those are by design. They‚Äôre supposed to be a fun brain teaser for true Sudoku fans. The challenge of trying to solve something someone has claimed isn‚Äôt solvable is a huge draw for these types of sites.\nIf you‚Äôre stuck on a puzzle there aren‚Äôt many options available. Your best bet is to erase everything and start with a clean slate. If you really wanted to challenge yourself you could start by erasing rows or columns with repeated numbers, but that could lead to more frustration.\nIf you start over, attempt a new strategy that you haven‚Äôt tried yet. It might be the fresh perspective you need to get the puzzle solved successfully. While every puzzle does have a solution, not every puzzle is solved by every person. Sudoku is a puzzle game that requires skill building. Don‚Äôt get too frustrated if you have to start over. It‚Äôs all part of the process.\nKeep testing strategies you‚Äôve learned about here and find what works for you. Even the best Sudoku solvers don‚Äôt use every strategy out there. The puzzle may only have one solution but how you get there is up to you.\nRemember it‚Äôs supposed to be a fun brain-teasing type of activity. Once you have some basics down you‚Äôll find you‚Äôre ready to tackle higher difficulty ranks and really enjoy your time spent playing."

Observation: "How to Play Sudoku?\n- Sudoku Rule ‚Ññ 1: Use Numbers 1-9\nSudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 ‚Äúsquares‚Äù (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square. Does it sound complicated? As you can see from the image below of an actual Sudoku grid, each Sudoku grid comes with a few spaces already filled in; the more spaces filled in, the easier the game ‚Äì the more difficult Sudoku puzzles have very few spaces that are already filled in.\n- Sudoku Rule ‚Ññ 2: Don‚Äôt Repeat Any Numbers\nAs you can see, in the upper left square (circled in blue), this square already has 7 out of the 9 spaces filled in. The only numbers missing from the square are 5 and 6. By seeing which numbers are missing from each square, row, or column, we can use process of elimination and deductive reasoning to decide which numbers need to go in each blank space.\nFor example, in the upper left square, we know we need to add a 5 and a 6 to be able to complete the square, but based on the neighboring rows and squares we cannot clearly deduce which number to add in which space. This means that we should ignore the upper left square for now, and try to fill in spaces in some other areas of the grid instead.\n- Sudoku Rule ‚Ññ 3: Don‚Äôt Guess\nSudoku is a game of logic and reasoning, so you shouldn‚Äôt have to guess. If you don‚Äôt know what number to put in a certain space, keep scanning the other areas of the grid until you seen an opportunity to place a number. But don‚Äôt try to ‚Äúforce‚Äù anything ‚Äì Sudoku rewards patience, insights, and recognition of patterns, not blind luck or guessing.\n- Sudoku Rule ‚Ññ 4: Use Process of Elimination\nWhat do we mean by using ‚Äúprocess of elimination‚Äù to play Sudoku? Here is an example. In this Sudoku grid (shown below), the far left-hand vertical column (circled in Blue) is missing only a few numbers: 1, 5 and 6.\nOne way to figure out which numbers can go in each space is to use ‚Äúprocess of elimination‚Äù by checking to see which other numbers are already included within each square ‚Äì since there can be no duplication of numbers 1-9 within each square (or row or column).\nIn this case, we can quickly notice that there are already number 1s in the top left and center left squares of the grid (with number 1s circled in red). This means that there is only one space remaining in the far left column where a 1 could possibly go ‚Äì circled in green. This is how the process of elimination works in Sudoku ‚Äì you find out which spaces are available, which numbers are missing ‚Äì and then deduce, based on the position of those numbers within the grid, which numbers fit into each space.\nSudoku rules are relatively uncomplicated ‚Äì but the game is infinitely varied, with millions of possible number combinations and a wide range of levels of difficulty. But it‚Äôs all based on the simple principles of using numbers 1-9, filling in the blank spaces based on deductive reasoning, and never repeating any numbers within each square, row or column."

Observation: "Sudoku is a popular number puzzle that consists of a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle includes a combination of numbers and some empty spaces, which you need to fill.\nWhen filling in the empty spaces, each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid should contain all digits from 1 to 9.\nA simple Python script can help solve a Sudoku puzzle for you. It can analyze all the empty spaces on the Sudoku board, and find a possible number to fill in each blank space.\nHow to Create and Display the Sudoku Board\nInside a Python script, you will need to use a list of arrays to store the values of the unsolved Sudoku puzzle.\nThe code used in this project is available in this GitHub repo under the MIT license.\n- Inside a new Python script called sudoku.py, store all the values for the 9x9 grid. Each row and column represents the nine numbers across and down the Sudoku puzzle. Add 0s to represent the spaces that need solving:\nboard = [\n[5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n[4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],\n[7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],\n[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]\n]\n- Inside a new function called print_board, use a for loop to process each row in the grid:\ndef print_board(board):\nfor row in range(9):\n- To separate each row into thirds, check if the row is divisible by three, and add a line:\nif row % 3 == 0 and row != 0:\nprint(\"- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \")\n- Within each row, loop through each column. You can also split columns into thirds by checking if the column is divisible by three:\nfor col in range(9):\nif col % 3 == 0 and col != 0:\nprint(\" | \", end=\"\")\n- Print the number value stored in the grid. If the column is the last column for that particular row, add a break line, so that the following row appears on a new line:\nif col == 8:\nprint(board[row][col])\nelse:\nprint(str(board[row][col]) + \" \", end=\"\")\n- Call the function to print the board:\nprint_board(board)\n- In a command line, navigate to the folder where you stored your python script, for example:\ncd Desktop\n- Use the python command to run your Sudoku script. View the puzzle printed onto the screen:\npython sudoku.py\nHow to Identify the Empty Spaces to Solve\nYou can traverse through the lists to find the spaces that consist of 0s. These determine which spaces needed solving.\n- In a new function called find_empty(), loop through each row and column on the board:\ndef find_empty(board):\nfor row in range(9):\nfor col in range(9):\n- If the value of the current cell is 0, return the current position of the empty cell:\nif board[row][col] == 0:\nreturn (row, col)\n- If the script reaches the end of the function, that means the script couldn't find any cells with the value of 0. In this case, do not return anything:\nreturn None\n- In a new function called solve(), use the find function to find the first empty space on the board:\ndef solve(board):\nfind = find_empty(board)\n- The find_empty() function returns the cell position in tuple format, for example, (0, 2). Save these values separately into the row and col variables. Otherwise, return true to signify that there are no empty spaces left to solve:\nif not find:\nreturn True\nelse:\nrow, col = find\nHow to Solve the Puzzle for Each Row, Column, and 3x3 Grid\nNow that you can identify the first empty space to solve, you will need to try and find an appropriate number to fill that space and solve the puzzle.\nUsing recursion, call the solve() function within itself to try every possible combination of values for all the other spaces as well.\n- Inside the solve() function, after finding the first empty space, loop through each number from 1 to 9. These numbers represent the possible numbers that could fill the unsolved space:\nfor num in range(1, 10):\n- Input the board, the possible number, and the position of the empty cell into a new function. The new function will return true if that number is a valid number that can solve that empty space. If it is valid, assign that number to the cell on the board:\nif is_valid(board, num, (row, col)):\nboard[row][col] = num\n- Create the is_valid() function, with matching parameters:\ndef is_valid(board, num, pos):\n- Use the function to check if placing the number in that position violates any rules of the Sudoku game. First, check if that number already exists in the row or column of the cell:\nfor col in range(9):\nif board[pos[0]][col] == num and pos[1] != col:\nreturn False\nfor row in range(9):\nif board[row][pos[1]] == num and pos[0] != row:\nreturn False\n- Get the 3x3 grid that the cell belongs to. You can do this by dividing the cell's position by three:\nbox_row = pos[0] // 3\nbox_col = pos[1] // 3\n- For each row and column in that 3x3 grid, check if the number already exists. If it does, return false:\nfor row in range(box_row*3, box_row*3 + 3):\nfor col in range(box_col*3, box_col*3 + 3):\nif board[row][col] == num and (row, col) != pos:\nreturn False\n- If the script reaches the end of the function, that means none of the Sudoku rules failed. Return true:\nreturn True\n- The is_valid() function only checks if the number placement is valid, but that does not mean it is the correct answer to the overall solution. Within the solve() function, call the solve() function again with the updated board. The solve() function may reach a state where it can no longer use any numbers to fill any spaces. In this case, the entire function returns false, resets that particular cell back to 0, and backtracks. The solve() function only returns true when the script can fill all spaces:\nfor num in range(1, 10):\nif is_valid(board, num, (row, col)):\nboard[row][col] = num\nif solve(board):\nreturn True\nboard[row][col] = 0\nreturn False\n- To start solving the puzzle, call the solve() function with the original board, at the bottom of the script, after declaring the solve() function:\nsolve(board)\n- Print the final result:\nprint(\"Solved:\")\nprint_board(board)\n- On the command line, use the python command to re-run the script. View the solved puzzle printed onto the screen:\npython sudoku.py\nCreating Games Using Python\nSudoku is just one of the many games you can create and solve using Python. You can use Python to create various other games, such as a word jumble, a text-based adventure game, or a color game, to name just a few."
