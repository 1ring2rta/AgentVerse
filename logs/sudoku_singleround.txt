Reviews:
[Bella]: Alright, so our task is to understand the rules of Sudoku, find a solution to the game, and write a Python script to solve it automatically. Here's my proposal for task decomposition:
1. Research the rules of the game Sudoku.
2. Research possible solutions to the game Sudoku.
3. Write a Python script to automate the solution.
Based on our expertise, I suggest the following task assignments:
Charlie, as a software engineer with expertise in Python, you could take on task 3, which is writing the Python script. I suggest you use the 'run_interpreter' tool for this.
Dana, with your background in machine learning and artificial intelligence, you could take on task 2, which is researching possible solutions to Sudoku. The 'bing_search' tool could be helpful for this.
As a computer scientist specializing in algorithm design and optimization, I can take on task 1, which is researching the rules of Sudoku. I will use the 'bing_search' tool to find this information.
Does this sound good to everyone?
Reviews:
[Charlie]: I agree with the task decomposition and assignment. It plays to each of our strengths. I'll start working on the Python script after Bella and Dana provide the rules and solution strategy of Sudoku. Let's do this!
Reviews:
[Dana]: That sounds like a good plan, Bella. I'll start on researching possible solutions to Sudoku using the 'bing_search' tool. Once we have all the information, we can compile it and move forward with the Python script. Let's get started!

Observation: "How to Play Sudoku?\n- Sudoku Rule № 1: Use Numbers 1-9\nSudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square. Does it sound complicated? As you can see from the image below of an actual Sudoku grid, each Sudoku grid comes with a few spaces already filled in; the more spaces filled in, the easier the game – the more difficult Sudoku puzzles have very few spaces that are already filled in.\n- Sudoku Rule № 2: Don’t Repeat Any Numbers\nAs you can see, in the upper left square (circled in blue), this square already has 7 out of the 9 spaces filled in. The only numbers missing from the square are 5 and 6. By seeing which numbers are missing from each square, row, or column, we can use process of elimination and deductive reasoning to decide which numbers need to go in each blank space.\nFor example, in the upper left square, we know we need to add a 5 and a 6 to be able to complete the square, but based on the neighboring rows and squares we cannot clearly deduce which number to add in which space. This means that we should ignore the upper left square for now, and try to fill in spaces in some other areas of the grid instead.\n- Sudoku Rule № 3: Don’t Guess\nSudoku is a game of logic and reasoning, so you shouldn’t have to guess. If you don’t know what number to put in a certain space, keep scanning the other areas of the grid until you seen an opportunity to place a number. But don’t try to “force” anything – Sudoku rewards patience, insights, and recognition of patterns, not blind luck or guessing.\n- Sudoku Rule № 4: Use Process of Elimination\nWhat do we mean by using “process of elimination” to play Sudoku? Here is an example. In this Sudoku grid (shown below), the far left-hand vertical column (circled in Blue) is missing only a few numbers: 1, 5 and 6.\nOne way to figure out which numbers can go in each space is to use “process of elimination” by checking to see which other numbers are already included within each square – since there can be no duplication of numbers 1-9 within each square (or row or column).\nIn this case, we can quickly notice that there are already number 1s in the top left and center left squares of the grid (with number 1s circled in red). This means that there is only one space remaining in the far left column where a 1 could possibly go – circled in green. This is how the process of elimination works in Sudoku – you find out which spaces are available, which numbers are missing – and then deduce, based on the position of those numbers within the grid, which numbers fit into each space.\nSudoku rules are relatively uncomplicated – but the game is infinitely varied, with millions of possible number combinations and a wide range of levels of difficulty. But it’s all based on the simple principles of using numbers 1-9, filling in the blank spaces based on deductive reasoning, and never repeating any numbers within each square, row or column."

Observation: "BEST\nof\nSudoku has become a very ubiquitous game in our world. People play it online, they play it in newspapers, and they play it while they’re bored on an airplane. Basically anywhere someone might have some downtime there’s probably someone playing sudoku. This math-based puzzle has taken the world by storm and the vast majority of people are thrilled about that.\nIf you’ve played you’ve definitely gotten to the dreaded point where you don’t know how to solve the puzzle. Maybe you erase and start over, or maybe you just give up. No matter what level of Sudoku you’re at, you’ve most likely wondered if there are strategies you can use to improve your game.\nJust like with solitaire or mahjong there are strategies out there that you can use to help increase your chances of solving the sudoku puzzle. It just takes some practice and research to figure out what the strategies are and how they work. If you’re hoping to up your game and get some well-deserved pats on the back from yourself you’re in good hands here.\nYou’re about to get a deep dive into the world of sudoku, the strategies, and the answers to questions you may have wondered at some point. Maybe you’ve asked yourself when sudoku took over the world as a boredom stopper. (It was invented in 1979 by Howard Garns who based it off of similar games dating back to the 18th century in case you’re curious.)\nBefore you pick up your pencil or open your app, take some time to read about the strategies and tips here. You might just be able to solve a higher level of puzzle by the time you’re done reading. It’s all about knowing how to work the game and enjoying it in the process. No one becomes a sudoku genius overnight but these strategies will definitely help.\nThe objective of Sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid made of squares (shown above circled in blue) so that each row, each column, and each full 9x9 square use the numbers 1-9. While solving the sudoku puzzle you can only use each number one time in the square, column, and row.\nColumns and rows are not limited by the thicker boundaries of the square (also sometimes called a region.) They run from the top of the puzzle to the bottom of the puzzle (as pictured in blue above). The same is true of rows. So while you may be focusing on a square, you’ll also have to remember other squares are affected by your choices.\nYou won’t be able to put a 1 in both the top left corner of the grid and the bottom left corner of the grid, for example. That entire space is a column, and as you already know, columns must not repeat any of the allowed numbers.\nNo. In a Magic Square, you also have to take into account the diagonal portion of the puzzle. Sudoku only focuses on the squares, rows, and columns in the grid. So, while the concepts are similar, they are not the exact same game.\nSome people claim Magic Squares are harder because of the added diagonal factor, while others claim Sudoku requires more concentration and logic. It really is dependent on what you like best, but in the end, they are still not the exact same thing.\nThere are a huge amount of variations on the basic 9x9 grid version of Sudoku. You can do puzzles that change the grid size to 6x6 or even 25x25. There are also other variations like Sudoku-X which adds in the factor of diagonals making it even more similar to a Magic Square.\nIn Sudoku Even-Odd you have shaded squares that must have either an even or an odd number, depending on the rules of that particular puzzle. In Hanidoku you use hexagonal shapes to create a “grid” that almost looks like a beehive.\nIn all variants the basic rules usually remain the same, they just add on some extra rules to increase the level of challenge for the avid Sudoku player to enjoy something new. There are tons of easily found variations of Sudoku you can try out once you master the basics and understand the strategies talked about as you keep reading.\nSudoku puzzles come prefilled with numbers in some of the cells. They are ranked by a difficulty level which corresponds with how many numbers come pre-filled in the puzzle. The higher the difficulty the fewer prefilled numbers you will have. The ratings go from one star (easiest) to five stars (hardest).\nJust like any other muscle your brain benefits from a good workout. If you find yourself doing mundane tasks daily Sudoku could be a way to sharpen your mind a little. It forces you to really think and plan. It gives you something to take all of your attention off of stressful days or worries.\nSudoku has also been linked to declines in the potential for dementia to progress and has helped patients with mental health issues regain some normal daily function abilities. How Sudoku can help your brain is really just about keeping your brain going and your mind sharp. Your individual benefits may not be the same as others, but it’s still offering you a constructive way to pass time.\nStarting your puzzle is sometimes a key part of making sure you solve the whole thing in the end. Because the puzzles are partially filled it can be difficult to make the first move. The best strategy here is to use the process of elimination. Look at what numbers you’d like to use and mark those numbers in the cells with a pencil.\nYou can make them small marks that are easily erased but make sure you’re putting any possible number in the cell. Then check to see if they’ve been repeated in any area you plan to place them. (See picture below)\nIf you’re using the process of elimination as your strategy you can see that although placing a 1 in the upper corner is tempting, it’s not a viable move. The number has already been used in the square. It also cannot be used in the column of the square below it because it has been prefilled there too. That leaves you with only one option. The bottom left.\nThis is how the process of elimination strategy works. You’ll have to broaden your view of the puzzle. Don’t fall into the trap of only looking at one square. Always remember columns and rows matter too. It’s all connected. Strategically eliminating possible moves is the best way to start your game.\nThis is a technique slightly the opposite of what you just read about. With crosshatching, you start by focusing on one 3x3 square and filling it in with the numbers needed. It’s a way to give you a starting point for your game that doesn’t involve looking at the entire grid.\nCrosshatching can be especially useful for brand new Sudoku players who are overwhelmed with an entire grid to fill. The downfall is that you could find yourself going back to correct a lot of errors as the puzzle gets more filled in. This doesn’t mean it’s a bad technique. It’s just something you should be aware of if you choose to start your puzzle this way.\nSudoku is not like solitaire where there’s some luck involved. There are definite ways to solve the puzzle. You might be able to guess and get a lucky right answer, but in general yes, sudoku is solved without guessing. Instead of guessing use strategic thoughtful moves.\nUse the strategy of “scan and find” instead of getting too stuck on one square on the grid. If you can’t figure out a number scanning and finding a good spot is always the better strategy. Guessing will not improve your game skills or chances of winning.\nThere are actually quite a few strategies sudoku lovers use, and which ones are best vary widely based on who you’re talking to. When it comes to sudoku the best strategy is going to be the one that makes the most sense to you. If a strategy just isn’t working there are others to try so don’t give up. Move on to the next strategy or combine several to get the puzzle solved.\nAs you read on you’ll be able to see some commonly used strategies that help people solve their puzzles. Some strategies are more difficult to master than others. Some strategies are meant for advanced players while others are great for beginners. It’s all about what’s going to work for you and what makes sense in your mind.\nTry not to get stuck on one specific strategy. It’s completely fine to have a favorite strategy to use but remember that sometimes you might need to use something else to solve the puzzle. If you’re finding yourself stuck think back to the other strategies you’re reading about here. Something is bound to help.\nIllustration Of A Naked Pair (As you can see each cell highlighted has 2 possible numbers.)\nThis strategy is based on looking at the puzzle and deciding which numbers are the only possibility for a specific cell. It’s similar to the process of elimination you would’ve used to start your puzzle. In a naked pair, you know you have 2 possible numbers that will be able to work in the pair, but you have yet to figure out which will go where.\nWhen you have a naked pair you can use this strategy to remove the idea of using the 2 numbers in any other row, square/region, or column. From there you’ll have to deduce which number makes the most sense based on looking at the row or column it’s in.\nIf you know the naked pair has either a two or a six as the possible answer, check to see where those numbers are used already. Remember, you can’t repeat any of the digits you’ve used.\nNaked pairs do not have to align within the grid. They can be naked pairs and be scattered within the square too.\nNo matter where they fall the point of the strategy is that you know there are only 2 possible numbers that can be placed in those cells and that you need to use the process of elimination to find the right one.\nThis same idea can also be applied to what more advanced players will call naked triplets (or threes) and naked quads. It’s more difficult than a pair because you’ll have 3 or 4 possible numbers which means you’ll have to solve more of the puzzle than you would with a naked pair.\nExample of how hidden pairs can distort the true options for a cell.\nThis is a great way to open up your grid and get a good feel for where to place numbers. The hidden pair strategy is a way to eliminate clusters of numbers from two cells which leaves you with simple options for the rest of the cells. It’s a building block for more advanced strategies later.\nTo use this strategy you’ll want to look at what numbers have been filled in already. Then look through your square, columns, and rows to rule out those numbers as options. When you do that you’ll be left with a simple pair of number options which you can build on to win the game.\nIn the above example, you can see that the hidden pair appears to have a multitude of options. Its true value is “hidden” by the appearance of several numeric possibilities. But if we apply the rule of looking through columns and rows we can see that the actual value of those cells is limited to being either a 6 or 7. You’ve used the hidden pairs strategy to rule out everything else.\nAgain, this strategy can be used in triplets or quads but that could take more practice. It’s not as easy to rule things out when you have more numeric choices. It’s best to start practicing this strategy with pairs and work your way up from there.\nImage Via Sudoku Wiki\nWhen you’re looking at your grid there may be a number that continues to pop up as a possibility within a specific square. If the numbers are aligned in the same column or row they are called a pointing pair. The pointing pair tells you the number must be used in that line and can be ruled out from other possible cells.\nIn other words, the repeated possibility aligned within a square “points” to where along the rest of the row or column you can eliminate the number. If you know 3 is a repeated possibility and they’re aligned in the same row or column within the square, you can then rule 3 out from any other cell in those rows or columns.\nThe 3 has to be placed within the square you’re looking at, it’s just a matter of figuring out which of the two cells the 3 will be used in. This helps you rule out a lot of possibilities and gives you the chance to fill in some rows or columns because you know a 3 can’t go in any of those cells. It’s a more methodical version of searching and eliminating without a plan.\nThis is another strategy to help eliminate possibilities and make the entire puzzle more easily solved. Are you noticing a theme with these strategies? It’s all about ruling out what can’t go somewhere instead of focusing on what should be put somewhere. Intersection removal is no exception to that line of thinking.\nIf any number occurs as a possibility two or three times in any one unit (row, square, or column) you can then remove that number from any intersecting other units. The key to using this strategy is to really fully understand what a unit is in the game. Remember that while it’s easy to focus on one square, you’re trying to solve the whole grid.\nImage Via Game Sudoku\nIf the pair or triplet of numbers intersects with another row, column or square it can be eliminated as a possibility for that intersecting unit. Another way to methodically use the process of elimination to get to the final result. This one just takes a little more focus on the entire grid than previous strategies mentioned.\nFor this strategy, you’re going to be looking at parallel rows and columns. You won’t be focusing on squares as much right now. It’s a strategy to remove possible numbers and erase some of those pencil marks you made when you started your game.\nTake a look at your rows and see if there are any pencil marks that are exactly the same in two spots. Match up that row with another row that mirrors it. The pencil marks must be exactly the same in the same two spots. You can see an example below to get a better idea.\nAs you can see, the parallel rows create an X giving this strategy its name. Looking at the example above you can now see that each of these rows has to have a 4 in it. You also know you can only place the 4 in either the slots that are dark blue, or light blue, since doing anything else would cause a repeated number in the row or column.\nAfter you’ve established your X formation, look at the entire grid again. See if there’s already a repeated number issue somewhere. This will guide you to the right choice to erase and the right cell to place the X formation numeral.\nThis is a strategy that takes a lot of thought but it does work very well. It’s not a strategy for beginners, but if you’re looking to improve your skills it’s a good choice. It will help you develop the skills required to move beyond focusing on just one square or one row or column. It helps you see the bigger picture.\nRemember how the X wing involved 2 possible numbers in two rows? This is the same idea, except now we’re looking at 3 possible numbers in 3 rows or columns. It’s an advanced strategy for sure. If you haven’t mastered the X wing strategy yet, you’ll likely find this strategy frustrating and possibly useless.\nImage Via Learn Sudoku\nWhile this strategy is not actually useless it is something that’s hard to spot when you’re looking at potential numbers for your cells. In the above image, the red lines show you that there’s a possibility for a 5 in the same slots in each of the red-lined rows.\nThe blue lines show you the slots where a 5 matches up and crosses the blue line itself. In short, the blue lines are showing you where you have the possibility of placing a five. If there is not a somewhere that a blue and red line intersect, you can eliminate five as a candidate in that cell.\nThe blue lines will not tell you WHICH cell the five goes in, it just shows you what to eliminate. In the image, you can see that with this strategy the cells highlighted in blue are the ones that might have a five. The cells that cannot have a five are highlighted in red.\nAgain, this is a highly advanced and somewhat complicated strategy to use for solving your puzzle. It’s best left to Sudoku fans that have been playing for a long time and truly understand how grid patterns work. If you’re just starting out and attempt this strategy you will likely be unable to see the patterns and end up not solving that particular puzzle.\nThis is a technique you can use when you haven’t found something that’s working for you on the puzzle yet. Maybe you’ve tried other strategies and you’re at an impasse or you just need a fresh perspective. Slicing and slotting breaks up the puzzle into rows of 3 for you to really analyze what’s missing or what’s incorrect.\nYou’ll compare the three rows going number by number. Start in numeric order and go up from there. So while you’re looking at your isolated 3 rows look for every blank spot and see what your possibilities (those pencil marks we talked about) are. This is especially effective if you’ve eliminated candidates at this point.\nWhile scanning your three rows look to see where there are already cells with the number you’re scanning for. If you’re using the number 1 as your first scan, for example, you’ll want to take note of where in those three rows that number already exists. If you find the number you’re scanning for, look to see how it interacts with your still unsolved cells.\nSo, if you’re scanning for the number one, and you find a 1 in the set of three rows you’re scanning check your candidates in that square, row, and column. If you have 1 as a candidate in any of those areas you now know you can eliminate it as a possibility. You wouldn’t be able to place a 1 there, because it’s already in the row, column, or square.\nImage via Sudoku Grader\nIn the image above you can see this more clearly. The red lines are showing you that in these three focused on columns, you cannot place a 2 anywhere there’s a red line. The 2 has been taken and cannot be reused in that row, square, or column. Therefore if you’d had a 2 as a candidate in one of the red line areas of this example, you could eliminate it.\nThis isn’t a guaranteed way to save your game from being unsolved but it is a good way to break things down. Sometimes you just need a micro focus that allows you to really see what’s going on. That’s what “slicing and slotting” can do for you while solving your Sudoku puzzle.\nIt depends on what you’re thinking of when you say “math.” This is why people who don’t understand the game often ask what the squares need to add up to in order to solve the puzzle. A Sudoku puzzle doesn’t require arithmetic, meaning you don’t have to add or subtract anything.\nFor a Sudoku game you really just need 9 symbols, and numbers just happen to be the most popular version. You could just as well use shapes and still present the same type of puzzle with the same rules and the same outcome. In fact, there are Sudoku versions where letters or symbols are used instead of numbers just to change things up.\nHowever, Sudoku does require mathmatically logical thinking. So when you’re asking if you can use math to solve a puzzle, the answer really is yes. It’s just probably not the kind of math you’re thinking of. Sudoku is solved with logical reasoning heavily based on concepts used in mathematics.\nIn most cases, there is only one solution for a Sudoku puzzle. If you find that a prefilled puzzle has more than one solution the publisher likely made a mistake, or you’ve completed the puzzle incorrectly. However, if the puzzle is blank there are definitely multiple solutions.\nIn the most extreme case where a puzzle has zero prefilled number clues, Wikipedia states there could be up to 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 solutions. So, while in general every puzzle only has one solution, if you did want to do a completely blank Sudoku puzzle, yes, there are definitely many solution options.\nWhile there seems to be some disagreement on this within the Sudoku fan community, most agree that a true Sudoku puzzle is never unsolvable. They state that a real Sudoku puzzle has one and only one solution. If you work on a puzzle that is unsolvable, it is either an error in printing, or not a true Sudoku puzzle. It is another type of game based on a Sudoku type of grid.\nThere are websites and publications dedicated to purposely creating unsolvable puzzles, but those are by design. They’re supposed to be a fun brain teaser for true Sudoku fans. The challenge of trying to solve something someone has claimed isn’t solvable is a huge draw for these types of sites.\nIf you’re stuck on a puzzle there aren’t many options available. Your best bet is to erase everything and start with a clean slate. If you really wanted to challenge yourself you could start by erasing rows or columns with repeated numbers, but that could lead to more frustration.\nIf you start over, attempt a new strategy that you haven’t tried yet. It might be the fresh perspective you need to get the puzzle solved successfully. While every puzzle does have a solution, not every puzzle is solved by every person. Sudoku is a puzzle game that requires skill building. Don’t get too frustrated if you have to start over. It’s all part of the process.\nKeep testing strategies you’ve learned about here and find what works for you. Even the best Sudoku solvers don’t use every strategy out there. The puzzle may only have one solution but how you get there is up to you.\nRemember it’s supposed to be a fun brain-teasing type of activity. Once you have some basics down you’ll find you’re ready to tackle higher difficulty ranks and really enjoy your time spent playing."

Observation: "How to Solve Sudoku Puzzles – A Complete Walkthrough, Part 1\nFirst, Look for “Low-Hanging Fruit”\nSudoku involves filling empty spaces with the number 1-9, without repeating any numbers within each row, column or square. This means that the entire puzzle should be able to be solved without guessing – that means you can use deductive reasoning, based solely on which numbers are already in place within each row, column or square, to figure out which numbers should go in which empty spaces.\nOne of the best ways to get started with solving a Sudoku puzzle is to look for “low-hanging fruit” – the rows, columns or squares that already have the most numbers filled in.\nThis will make it easier (most of the time) for you to figure out which numbers go in the remaining empty spaces.\nFor example, in this puzzle to above, the column and row that are outlined in blue, and the squares outlined in green (in the lower right), all have only three empty spaces.\nThat means that these sections of the Sudoku puzzle are a good place to start.\nLet’s start by looking at the center square in the bottom row of the grid, shown here (in the figure below) outlined in green.\nUse Process of Elimination\nWe know that there are three empty spaces in this square, which must contain the missing numbers of 5, 6 and 7. If we look to nearby squares for other instances of 6 and 7, we might be able to eliminate possibilities and see which number should go in which space.\nFortunately, if we look to the top row of the grid, we see a 7 (circled in red) and in the lower right corner of the grid (bottom row) we see a 6 (circled in red).\nThis means that the empty space (circled in blue) in the bottom row cannot contain 7 or 6, and must contain number 5.\nNow let’s look to the other “low-hanging fruit” square, in the lower-right corner, shown in the figure to the left, outlined in green.\nThis square also has only three empty spaces. By checking to see which numbers are already in place (1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9), we know that the missing numbers are 3, 5 and 7.\nIf we look above, we can see a 5 and 7 in the central row of the square (circled in red), so that means that the top center space must contain a 3 (in blue). Also, if we look to the left, we can see 5 (circled in red), which means that the upper left space of the square cannot contain 5, so that means the 5 has to go in the left-center space (marked in blue) and the last remaining empty space has to be a 7. This is how we can use simple process of elimination to figure out which numbers go in which spaces, starting with the “low-hanging fruit” that is given to us by the Sudoku grid.\nPlease read part 2 of this series on how to solve Sudoku puzzles, using this actual game as an example.

Our trained team of editors and researchers validate articles for accuracy and comprehensiveness. wikiHow's Content Management Team carefully monitors the work from our editorial staff to ensure that each article is backed by trusted research and meets our high quality standards.\nThis article has been viewed 2,563,418 times.\nLearn more...\nYou want to try sudoku, but you don't know where to begin. Sudoku looks hard because it involves numbers, but in reality, it's not math-based. Even if you think you're bad at math, you can still do well at sudoku. In fact, the numbers could be replaced with letters or symbols and the results would be the same; it's all about recognizing the pattern. Start by learning the basics of sudoku, then move on to learning the beginning and advanced techniques.\nSteps\nFiguring Out the Basics\n-\n1Learn the setup. In a typical sudoku, you'll have a square grid of 9 large squares. Inside each of those larger squares will be 9 smaller squares. When faced with a puzzle, some of those smaller squares will be filled in with numbers from 1 to 9. More difficult puzzles will have fewer squares filled in.[1] X Research source\n- The larger squares are often outlined with a darker line, while the smaller squares have a thinner line. Also, sometimes the larger squares will be colored in a checkerboard pattern.\n-\n2Line up the rows and columns. One basic rule of the game is every column and row must have all of the numbers from 1 to 9. That means that within a row or column, a number cannot repeat.Advertisement\n-\n3Pay attention to the numbers in the large squares. Similarly, in each of the 9 large squares, every number from 1 to 9 must appear. Once again, that means that each number can only appear once, as there's only 9 smaller squares in each larger square.\n- So, if a large square already has the number “2” in it, you know it can’t include another number “2” anywhere in the square.\n-\n4Use a pencil instead of a pen. As a new sudoku player, you're going to make mistakes, and with a pen, you'll end up with a mess of a board. Instead, use a pencil so you can erase mistakes. Remember to press lightly so you can erase mistakes better.\nStarting with Easy Hints\n-\n1Look for a single empty in a larger square. Check each square to see if it has a single square open. If it does, it's easy to fill in. Just figure out what number is missing from 1 to 9.[2] X Research source\n- For example, if a larger square has numbers 1-3 and 5-9, you know it's missing the number \"4,\" which you can fill in.\n-\n2Check for singular empty squares in the rows and columns. Run your finger down each row and column to see if any of them only have 1 square open. If a row does, figure out which number from 1 to 9 is missing in that row or column and fill it in.[3] X Research source\n- If a column has numbers 1-7 and 9, you know it's missing the number \"8,\" which you can fill in.\n-\n3Scan rows or columns to fill in larger squares. Look at a row of 3 large squares. Check for a number that's repeated 2 times in different squares. Run your fingers along the rows that contain that number. The third large square must contain the same number, but it can't be in 1 of the 2 rows you're tracing. It must be in the third row. Sometimes, 2 other numbers will be in that row, so you can easily fill in the number you're scanning.[4] X Research source\n- If \"8\" is repeated in 2 squares, look for that number in the third square. Run your finger down the rows with each \"8,\" as you know the \"8\" can't be in those rows in the third large square.\n-\n4Add the opposite direction. Once you've got the hang of scanning across just rows or columns, add the other direction as well. Take the previous example with a slight difference. When you get to the third square, it only has 1 number filled in in the open row.[5] X Research source\n- In that case, trace down the columns. See if the number you're trying to fill in is in 1 of the columns. In that case, you know it can't go in that column and must go in the other one.\n-\n5Work in groups of numbers. That is, if you see that you have a lot of one number on the board, it can help to start trying to fill in the rest of that number. Say you have a large number of 5s on the board. Use your scanning techniques to fill in as many 5s as you can.\nUsing More Difficult Techniques\n-\n1Look at a set of 3 large squares. Another option is to include 3 of the large squares in a row or column in your analysis. Pick 1 number, and see if you can place it across all 3 squares.[6] X Research source\n- For instance, take the number \"6.\" See which rows and columns already have 6s, and use that to scan across to the 3 large squares you're looking at. Based on that information and what you have in the squares, try to place as many of the 6s as you can.\n-\n2Pencil in numbers. As puzzles get more difficult, you'll find that just using the above techniques won't always solve the puzzle. In those cases, you need to start filling in what numbers could possibly go in each square. When you get a possibility, place it in the corner of a small square in pencil. You may have as many as 3 or 4 numbers penciled in as you try to solve the puzzle.[7] X Research source\n- As you work, you may notice certain squares only have 1 number, and you may be able to fill in that number permanently.\n-\n3Recheck often. As you fill in numbers, go back over the puzzle to figure out spaces you had to leave blank before. Once you've filled in new numbers, you may be able to figure out those spaces.\n- As you recheck the blank spaces, go through the techniques again to help fill in numbers.\nSample Sudoku Puzzles\nBlank Sudoku Template\nCommunity Q&A\n-\nQuestionAre all sudoku puzzles solvable?Community AnswerYes, unless the puzzle was printed with an error, which is unlikely.\n-\nQuestionWhen all of the squares are the correct numbers, can I assume the rows and columns are correct?Community AnswerThe numbers in the 9 squares cannot be \"correct,\" as you say, unless the rows and columns are also correct. You can have all 9 squares with all 9 numbers, but that does not guarantee that the rows and columns will be correct.\n-\nQuestionIs there an easy way to play sudoku?EllieCommunity AnswerOnce you get the hang of it, it will become pretty easy and fun.\nVideo\nTips\nWarnings\n- For every cell you fill in, make sure you double-check your logic; a single error could mess up the entire puzzle.Thanks\nReferences\n- ↑ http://www.paulspages.co.uk/sudoku/howtosolve/\n- ↑ https://2012.ateneo.edu/news/features/ten-tips-solving-sudoku-puzzles\n- ↑ https://2012.ateneo.edu/news/features/ten-tips-solving-sudoku-puzzles\n- ↑ http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/sudoku/techniques\n- ↑ http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/sudoku/techniques\n- ↑ http://www.paulspages.co.uk/sudoku/howtosolve/\n- ↑ http://www.paulspages.co.uk/sudoku/howtosolve/\nAbout This Article\nSudoku is a game played on a 9 x 9 grid where the object of the game is to fill every space with the correct number. The grid is divided into 9 separate 3 x 3 squares. To complete the grid, every column, row and square (each containing 9 spaces) needs to be filled in with the numbers 1-9 without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square. Some squares already have numbers filled in, so begin by look for missing numbers in a row, column or square. For example, if a square already has 7 out of the 9 spaces filled in, you can figure out which 2 numbers are missing and use the numbers in the correlating rows and columns to determine which of the two missing numbers belongs in each space. If you see a single empty space in a larger square, fill that in first. Then look for single empty squares in each row and column that you can fill in. Next, you can start scanning each row for a certain number, like 1, to see where it should go. Every Sudoku has one solution, so double check by making sure each column, row and square contains the numbers 1-9 with no duplicates or omissions. Continue using logic and deduction until you have filled in all of the empty squares. Once you have filled in all of the squares with the correct numbers, you win the game!

2. Don’t Repeat Any Numbers: Each square, row, or column should not have any repeated numbers.
3. Don’t Guess: Sudoku is a game of logic and reasoning, so guessing is not recommended. If you don’t know what number to put in a certain space, keep scanning the other areas of the grid until you seen an opportunity to place a number.
4. Use Process of Elimination: The process of elimination is used to determine which numbers can go in each space based on the other numbers that are already in each square, row, and column.
These rules make Sudoku a game of logic, insights, and recognition of patterns.
