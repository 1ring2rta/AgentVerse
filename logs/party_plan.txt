Reviews:
[Li Mei]: Understood. Let's break down the requirements: first, we need to find the best places to hold a party around Tsinghua University; second, we need to predict the weather there for tomorrow; and finally, we need to brainstorm some party activities.
I suggest the following sub-tasks: I, as a meteorologist, can use the RapidAPIEnv_rapi_weather_api_by_any_city_get_weather_updates tool to get the weather updates for Tsinghua University area tomorrow. Wang Lei, with your web research skills, you can use the bing_search tool to look for the best places for a party near Tsinghua University. Liu Yang, as an entertainment coordinator, you can use the WebEnv_browse_website tool to find some popular party activities that can be considered.
Does this task decomposition sound reasonable to everyone?
