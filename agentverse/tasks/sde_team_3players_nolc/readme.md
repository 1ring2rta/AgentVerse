# A SDE team with three players

### Roles

- *code writer*: write Python code to fill in a function body given function signature and doc string. The generated code will be automatically tested on a series of unit test cases. This role is required to refine the previously submitted code if it haven't passed all the tests. Test feedback and a code review will be given in this case.
- *code reviewer*: write detailed code review of the code submitted by the code writer considering the feedback of the unit test.
- *unit test generator*: generate a series of unit test cases for the coding problem.

### Note

The generated unit tests are always perfect. They may not be correct and diversified. We will tune our method to encourage more diversity. We also plan to incorporate execution tools to raise the correctness of the generated cases.
